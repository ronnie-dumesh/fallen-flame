/*
 * Ship.java
 * 
 * This is a model class representing ships. It is slightly more complex than Photon, in
 * that is it not limited to just setters and getters -- it has an update loop.  This is
 * because we want to process some complicated code regarding turning drift.  As this 
 * code makes no reference to any other object other than the ship, it is safe to put
 * it in this class properly.
 *
 * This is a "passive" model.  It does not access the methods or fields of any other 
 * Model class.  It also does not store any other model object as a field. This allows us
 * to keep the models from being tightly coupled.
 *
 * This decision makes a slight complication when it comes to photon ownership.  We do 
 * not want a ship to be hit by its own photons, so each photon needs an owner.  But we 
 * do not want to store a ship object in an photon.  We solve this problem by storing 
 * the ship id in the photon instead.  Id numbers are a classic technique for decoupling 
 * classes from one another.
